  1. Write a program to calculate the minimum number of swaps to sort the array
  2. Write a program to Sort an array in wave form
  3. Given an array of positive and negative numbers, arrange them in an alternate fashion such that
     every positive number is followed by a negative and vice-versa maintaining the order of
     appearance.

     Examples
     Input: 1,2,3,-4,-1,4
     Output: -4,1,-1,2,3,4
  4. Question 2: Median Sort
     Given are some integers, which are read from the data stream. The task is to find the median of the
     integers read so far.

     The median is the middle value of a sorted list of integers. If the size of the list is even, the median is
     the average of the two middle elements.

     Example

     Input: 1,2, 3,...

     Output: 1,1.5,2...
  5. Pairs with Min Diff
     Given an array of distinct integers arr, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements.
     Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair [a, b] follows.
     a,b are from arr
     a<b
     b- a equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in arr
     Example
     Input; arr = [4.2,1,3]
     Output: [[1,2],(2,3][34]]
  6. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
     There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

     Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in
     nums, or -1 if itis not in num.

     Example

     Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2), target = 0

     Output: 4
  7. Find first and last Position of Element in Sorted Array

     Given an array of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of
     a given target value.

     If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

     Example

     Input: nums =[5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8

     Output: [3,4]
